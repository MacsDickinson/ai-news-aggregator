# AI-Driven News Aggregation & Social Commentary Platform: 1-Pager PRD

---

## Description

An AI-powered platform that aggregates news from diverse sources, summarizes key stories, and enables users to create and share insightful social commentary. The platform delivers a personalized, clutter-free news feed, encourages thoughtful discussion, and empowers users to contribute context, analysis, and perspectives on current events.

---

## Problem

Staying informed is overwhelming due to information overload, fragmented sources, and the lack of accessible, high-quality discussionâ€”users struggle to efficiently find, understand, and engage with trustworthy news and meaningful commentary.

---

## Why

* **Information Overload:** 65% of news consumers report feeling overwhelmed by the volume of news and struggle to keep up (Pew Research, 2023).

* **Fragmented Sources:** Users often visit multiple platforms to get a complete picture, leading to time inefficiency and missed context.

* **Low-Quality Discourse:** Social media comment sections are frequently dominated by noise, misinformation, and low-value engagement, discouraging thoughtful participation.

* **Demand for Personalisation:** 72% of users want news tailored to their interests, but most platforms offer limited customisation (Reuters Institute, 2023).

* **Rising Misinformation:** The spread of unverified news and lack of context erodes trust and makes it harder for users to form informed opinions.

---

## Success

Success means users rely on the platform as their primary news source, actively contribute high-quality commentary, and report a significant reduction in time spent searching for trustworthy news and discussion.
