# AI-Driven News Aggregation Platform - Milestone 1 Implementation Plan

## Summary

Implementation of the basic news aggregation workflow for Milestone 1, focusing on single-topic news aggregation with AI-powered weekly summaries. This milestone establishes the foundational architecture using Node.js/TypeScript backend with Remix.js frontend, Postgres database, and OpenAI integration.

## Goals

- Build minimal viable workflow for single-topic news aggregation
- Implement AI-powered weekly summary generation
- Create simple, clean web interface for viewing summaries
- Establish solid foundation for future milestone development
- Aggregate 50+ articles per week on chosen topic

## Approach

- Start with writing tests before making any changes to the code
- All work must be validated by the tests
- All code should have appropriate TypeScript types and JSDoc comments
- All code should validate using testing and linting commands
- Follow test-driven development practices

## Useful commands

All commands are to be ran from the root directory unless stated otherwise. Use as stated below and do not consider running commands any other way.

- `npm install` - install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - start development server
- `npm run build` - build the application
- `npm run test` - run vitest tests
- `npm run test:watch` - run tests in watch mode
- `npm run lint` - run ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - run TypeScript compiler check
- `npm run db:migrate` - run database migrations
- `npm run db:seed` - seed database with initial data

## Strict instructions

- You MUST validate your work with `npm run test` from the root directory
- You MUST validate your work with `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` from the root directory
- You MUST NOT make assumptions. Seek clarification from the user if you are unsure
- You MUST update this plan file when you have completed a task, showing what tasks have been completed and provide a short summary of what has been done for that task
- You MUST complete a final validation (using `npm run build` and all test commands) and update this plan with a statement

## Notes for implementation

### Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Frontend**: Remix.js with TypeScript and React
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT API for summarization
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit/integration tests, Playwright for e2e tests
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode

### Key Design Decisions
- Single topic focus for MVP to reduce complexity
- Weekly summary cadence to manage AI costs and provide meaningful aggregation
- RSS + API approach for diverse news source coverage
- Simple web-only interface to focus on core functionality

### External Dependencies
- News APIs (NewsAPI, Guardian API, or similar)
- OpenAI API access and billing setup
- PostgreSQL database (local for dev, hosted for production)

### Risk Mitigation
- Mock external services in tests to avoid dependency on third-party APIs
- Implement rate limiting and error handling for all external API calls
- Design database schema to be extensible for future milestones
- Keep UI simple to focus on backend functionality
