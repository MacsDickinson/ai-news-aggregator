Use Linear MCP to manage issues and status:
1) Fetch issue: “Get Linear issue APP-123” or search within team.
2) Summarize acceptance criteria and dependencies.
3) Create a feature branch: `feat/APP-123-kebab-summary`.
4) Implement with tests and docs.
5) Run validations: build, lint, type-check, test.
6) Update Linear status/comments; open PR and include key in title.
