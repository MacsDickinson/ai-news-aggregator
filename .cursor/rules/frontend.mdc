- Framework: Remix + React + TypeScript.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Components: Named exports; props interfaces at top; avoid inline styles for reusable components.
- Accessibility: Semantic headings, focus outlines, ARIA labels; keyboard shortcuts `j/k/e/s/d`.
- State: Favor loader/actions and hooks; keep components pure; avoid implicit globals.
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library; test critical flows.
- Constraints: LinkedIn post length limits enforced in UI; show counters.
- UX: Editor with version history; toasts for generation/publish progress.

Routes to maintain: `/feed`, `/drafts`, `/settings`, `/roundups`, `/admin`.
